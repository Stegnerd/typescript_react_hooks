   * If the array is empty, the function will get executed once during the
   *  mounting of the component, and the return function will be executed during unmounting.
   *  For example, this can be used to initiate API calls to fetch data that needs to be shown on the UI.
   *
   * If no array is provided, the function will be executed on before and after each render,
   *  this is used to record how many times rendering is taking place.
   *
   * If there is any state variable inside the array, then the effects function is executed once on the mounting of the component,
   *  and then each time the state is changed, the function is called. A very useful example of this property is,
   *  suppose you want to show an autosuggest options, letâ€™s say user is typing in an input field and based on
   *  the initial text you want to show him auto-suggested words/sentence, then you can use this property to
   *  fetch the data from backend each time the input value is changing.
